# Knock Knock Knock… Data! 

If you’ve ever watched *The Big Bang Theory*, you probably remember Sheldon’s signature knock.

> Knock knock knock, Penny.  
> Knock knock knock, Penny.  
> Knock knock knock, Penny.

He does it every time. It’s one of those small things that becomes part of who he is.

So I had a random thought one day,  
**How many times did Sheldon actually knock?**

That led me down a fun little rabbit hole where I ended up analyzing all 10 seasons of the show to find out.

## What I Found

Sheldon knocked  
**281 times**  
in total, always in sets of three.

## What’s in This Project

- `1_10_seasons_tbbt.csv` → the full script dataset  
- `sheldon_knocks.sql` → the SQL I used to count the knocks  
- `sheldon_knock_viz.png` → the final Power BI visualization  
- `infographic_design_notes.md` → some quick thoughts on the design process

---

## How I Did It

1. Loaded the dialogue into SQL Server  
2. Filtered only Sheldon’s lines that had the word “knock”  
3. Looked for patterns like “(Knock, knock, knock) Penny”  
4. Counted everything up  
5. Built a clean, fun visual in Power BI to show it

## Why I Made This

Honestly, just for fun (also, I am a fan of the show!)

I wanted to practice SQL and data storytelling, but I also wanted to work on something that made people smile. And if you're a fan of the show, chances are this gave you a little flashback too.

## A Little Extra (from Penny)

Thanks for stopping by!  
Hope you enjoyed this as much as I did.
